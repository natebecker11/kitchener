Kitchen Management Tool

This is a mobile-responsive tool for managing ingredients, recipes, and shopping lists for our kitchen. There are a few pieces of functionality that will be built in.

## Add inventory
A user will be able to add stock to the inventory, selecting from a range of Trader Joe's products, as well as fresh produce/proteins from other sources. As an eventual goal, a user will be able to snap a picture of their Trader Joe's receipt to automatically replenish stock levels.

## Add recipes
A user will be able to add a recipe, which will correlate directly to Trader Joe's products. For example meatballs might take 1 package of TJ's ground beef, and .1 container of TJ's ground almond flour.

## Decrement inventory by recipe
A user will be able to simply press a button to indicate they have cooked a particular recipe, removing the ingredients from the inventory. Initially this will be fixed amounts, but eventually a user will be able to specify a number of servings made.

## Generate shopping list
A user will be able to choose which meals to make for the following week, and with a button-press generate an appropriate shopping list. Eventually, this will also look at user-entered prices to determine if there is a better deal to be had at another store for generic items, ie produce.
